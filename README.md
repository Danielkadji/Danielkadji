## About Me
🎓 I'm a Software Engineer with 2 years of industry experience and a current graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

💻 Passionate about developing the world of tomorrow, I have a strong background in software engineering, web development, and AI/ML technologies, including experience with tools like sklearn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Node.js.

🌟 During my academic and professional journey, I've worked at two internships and built a total of 6 personal projects — all expanding my expertise in ML/AI and software development.

🚀 I'm always eager to tackle challenging problems, build onto my expertise, and grow as an innovator.
